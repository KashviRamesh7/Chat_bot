This Streamlit app is a Document Q&A Chatbot powered by Cohere LLMs and FAISS. It allows users to upload PDF, DOCX, and Excel files, extracts and processes their content, and stores it as embeddings. Using LangChainâ€™s Conversational Retrieval Chain, the bot retrieves relevant text chunks for each query. The chatbot supports multi-turn conversations with preserved context via Streamlit session state. Built with Cohere Embeddings + ChatCohere, it provides fast, intelligent, and document-aware answers.
